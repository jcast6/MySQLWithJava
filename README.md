# MySQLWithJava-Practice

The following apps connects to a MySql database, followed by having the user login at the sign in page. After this the user will be taken to the options page,
here the user can select whether they want to see the inventory, check prices etc... The data used to generate the results of logging in, seeing the inventory, 
prices and others are located in a MySql database, called getting_data. This is a working progress, and this program is used to help me 
understand how Java and MySql concepts.

Steps: 
1. create a MySql database 'getting_data'
2. create tables in getting_data.
    - emp_login table
    - products_with_amounts table
    - stock_inventory table, this is just a table of the products
    
3. get excel sheet of the products with amounts and import data into tables
    - export your excel file of data in Excel to CSV and import that in MySQL Workbench using 
      the MySql "Table data import Wizard".
